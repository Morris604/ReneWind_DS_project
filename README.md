 Predictive Maintenance for Wind Turbines | Data Science Project
• Built and evaluated multiple classification models (SVC, Random Forest, Bagging Classifier) to predict gener
ator failures in wind turbines using sensor data (40 features, 20,000+ observations).
 • Handled highly imbalanced data using over/under-sampling techniques, improving model robustness and
 performance.
 • Performed data cleaning, EDA, and handled class imbalance with over-sampling and under-sampling tech
niques.
 • Achieved best performance with an SVC model on over-sampled data: 99% accuracy, 84% recall, 90.8% F1
score.
 • Delivered actionable insights to support cost-effective predictive maintenance and reduce downtime.
